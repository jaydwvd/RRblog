<p><strong>Roof Replacement: When and Why ?</strong><br>
<img src="https://ibb.co/c8Kk0b4" alt="Roof"><br>
When it comes to keeping your home in good order, roofing repair is extremely important. First of all, your roof plays a huge role in the appearance of your home. The roof is often the first thing people notice about a house. A poorly maintained roof can be an instant to turn off to a visitor, and more importantly, it can bring down the value of your home. Even if you don’t want to sell your house now, it’s still easier to repair your roof now than worry about it later when time may be a factor.</p>
<p>Roofing repair is important from a practical standpoint also. You need to have a roof over your head in order to keep your home comfortable for your family and pets. Also, a damaged roof can lead to damage in the other parts of your house. A leaky roof can allow water to enter your home and accumulate where it shouldn’t, which can lead to mold and other problems. And even if a hole in your roof doesn’t let in much moisture, it can still leave your home vulnerable to animal or bug infestation. Also, much like health problems in a person, a section of your roof that needs repairing will only get worse the longer you leave it be.</p>
<p><strong>Causes for repair:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>REGULAR MAINTENANCE IDENTIFIES THE CAUSE OF ROOFING PROBLEMS – Roofs eventually fail at some point. The key to prolonging its service life is to identify what causes roofing problems. For example, in roof leaks, water stains aren’t the real problem – it’s merely the symptom of a hole in the roof. Fortunately, we perform maintenance inspections that don’t just patch up holes in the roof. We find out what causes (or what could cause) the holes in the first place and apply a permanent solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REPAIRS PREVENT EXISTING PROBLEMS FROM GETTING BIGGER – Don’t wait until your next scheduled maintenance if you discover roofing problems by yourself. Roofing problems, no matter how small, can quickly escalate if not fixed in a timely manner. We understand how critical timely repairs can be, which is why we offer storm damage repair services and insurance claim assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REGULAR MAINTENANCE KEEPS YOUR ROOF BEAUTIFUL LONGER – Regular maintenance keeps your roof in good condition. Consequently, your roof also keeps it looks for longer. Even if the roof colors fade, as long as there are no missing, damaged, or curled shingles, your roof would look like new when seen from the curb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TIMELY REPAIRS AND REGULAR MAINTENANCE SAVE YOU MONEY – Regular maintenance and small repairs is much more affordable – not to mention more manageable – compared to the cost of a major repair or replacement project. Most roofing warranties also require regular maintenance checks, otherwise it would void the warranty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WEATHER PROTECTION</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If your roof is in poor condition, it can leave your home susceptible to considerable weather damage. When your roof is properly maintained, it will more effectively protect your home from the harsh weather and the elements.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND COMFORT</li>
</ol>
<p>A roof that is in top shape should have good insulation and a proper ventilation system which will keep your home’s indoor temperature steady. This helps to keep your home more comfortable and can significantly cut down on energy costs.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>SERIOUS ISSUES</li>
</ol>
<p>By taking the time to maintain the health of your roof, you reduce the chance of potentially serious issues in the long run. It will also help you locate any small problems before they turn into larger, costlier issues. If you spot anything that could be a concern, it’s important to have a company that provides roof repair in Jacksonville take a look at it asap.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>CURB APPEAL</li>
</ol>
<p>When your roof shows signs of wear and tear, it detracts from your home’s overall appearance.<br>
Since a home’s roof is one of its most prominent features, one that is beautiful and well maintained will add great curb appeal.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>HEALTH CONCERNS</li>
</ol>
<p>A leaking roof that goes ignored can cause mold and mildew to grow in your home, which can lead to some serious health issues. Once mold and mildew have spread, the repairs become much more complicated and costly.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>HOME VALUE</li>
</ol>
<p>A good-looking roof is a selling point that increases a home’s value. Potential buyers are wary of buying a home that has an older roof or one that may need repairs. A roof that is in newer, well-maintained condition can significantly increase the value of your home.</p>
<p>Although many homeowners give little thought to the care and maintenance of their roof, it’s actually one of the most important elements of a home. A healthy roof protects your home from the elements, saves energy, helps avoid serious leaks, adds curb appeal and value and can even help keep your family healthy.</p>
<p><strong>General cost of repairing a roof:</strong><br>
<img src="https://ibb.co/nsM2tKs" alt="Roof Repair"><br>
It needs to be stated that not all roofs are made the same and not all roofers charge the same prices. That said, on average, most contractors will charge between $3.50 and $5.50 per square foot or $350 to $550 per square (100 sq. Ft.) to install or replace an asphalt shingle roof on a typical house.</p>
<p>Thus, at the midpoint of the above price range, you can expect to pay about $4.50 per sq. ft. or $450 per square to replace an asphalt shingle roof on a typical single-family house.</p>
<p>A typical roof replacement quote will normally include the removal and disposal of up to two layers of old shingles. It should also include the installation of new underlayment such as the 30-pound roofing felt, chimney re-flashing, and ice-and-water shield at the eaves and valleys of the roof, as required by the local building code. The quote should also include a 5 or 10-year workmanship warranty.</p>
<p>What About Prices for Other, Less-Common Roofing Systems?</p>
<p>While nearly 70 percent of all roofs in the US are covered with composition shingles (a composite of fiberglass mat, and asphalt and minerals/stone granules), there are many different roofing options for steep and low-slope roofs.</p>
<p>Below is a quick reference to help you compare average prices for the most common roofing systems based on a 17-squares residential roof:</p>
<p>Basic 3-Tab (25-year) shingles: $6,000 to $7,500<br>
30-year architectural shingles: $7,000 to $9,500<br>
50-year premium shingles: $8,500 to $12,750<br>
G-90 steel shingles or stone-coated steel tiles: $11,900 to $17,000<br>
Aluminum shingles: $12,750 to $18,700<br>
Cedar shingles or shakes: $13,000 to $20,400<br>
Standing seam: $14,450 to $20,400<br>
Concrete tiles: $13,600 to $23,800 (roof-frame requires reinforcement)<br>
Natural slate tiles: $15,300 to $30,600 (roof-frame requires reinforcement)<br>
Synthetic shakes and slate tiles: $13,000 to $20,400<br>
Clay tiles: $17,000 to $30,600 (roof-frame requires reinforcement)</p>
<p>Asphalt Shingles Materials and Installation Costs</p>
<p>Many professional roofing contractors employ a “40% materials / 60% labor” as their costs-breakdown formula. Of course, this pricing structure is just a guideline not set in stone. Some contractors include their overhead in the cost of labor, while others calculate it separately.</p>
<p>Below is the breakdown of typical costs you can expect for materials and professional installation:</p>
<ol>
<li>3-tab Shingles</li>
<li>30-Year Architectural Shingles</li>
<li>Premium Shingles</li>
</ol>
<p>3-tab 25 Year Shingles</p>
<p>The cost of materials for a basic 3-tab, 25-year shingles could range anywhere from $150 to $200 per square for all the necessary materials. — In addition to composition shingles, materials may also include any necessary roofing felt/underlayment, ice-and-water shield, nails, ridge-vent, and roof flashing details such as valley, drip-edge, gable, and chimney flashing and caulk.</p>
<p>In some cases, the cost of materials may also include the cost of plywood, wood planks/boards, permitting, trash bags, and ordering a dumpster.</p>
<p>With most professional — licensed &amp; insured roofing contractors, the installation cost is usually about 60% of the total cost. Thus, a 3-tab composition shingle roof will cost an average of $350 to $450 per square to install.</p>
<p>The installation assumes a single-story house such as ranch, cape, or colonial, with a hip and gable combination roof.</p>
<p>Most ranch style homes in the US, measure an average of 15 to 20 squares in terms of the actual roof surface. This translates to $6,725 to $9,000 for the very basic composition shingles roof installed, based on the average installed cost of $450 per square, with a typical 5-year workmanship warranty.</p>
<p>30-Year Architectural / Dimensional Shingles</p>
<p>You can expect to pay a bit more for a 30-year architectural aka dimensional shingles. These shingles are a fair bit thicker and hence longer lasting than the basic 3-tab shingles. Contractors wanting to offer better value to a homeowner will typically suggest installing architectural shingles.</p>
<p>Architectural shingles will typically cost you $50 to $100 more per square to install than the basic 3-tab 25-year shingles. — The difference in price is actually greater than the difference in the cost of materials between the 3-tab and 30-year architectural shingles. Most contractors will put a greater mark-up on the higher-end product vs. the entry-level product. The pricing increase is normally justified as the premium on the “higher quality of installation”. We’ll let you be the judge.</p>
<p>Thus, your total cost for a basic, single-story hip and gable roof on a typical ranch-style house could range anywhere from $7,850 to $11,000, depending on the size and complexity of the roof, the company you choose to hire, quality of installation, warranty details, your home’s geographic location, your negotiation skills, and other variables.</p>
<p>Premium Shingles — 50 Year Shingles</p>
<p>With premium shingles, such as 50-year architectural shingles, your total average cost could range from $450 to $750 per square installed, or anywhere from $9,000 to $15,000, depending on the company you choose to hire, roof access/difficulty, your home’s location, etc.</p>
<p>Some premium shingle profiles can cost as much as $50.00 per bundle, while requiring four or five bundles, depending on the profile, to cover a square of roofing surface.</p>
<p>Thus, the cost of premium shingles alone can be as high as $200 to $250 per square, not including the cost of other necessary materials and supplies.</p>
<p>A part of the increase in your total installation cost for premium shingles should be reflected and offset by a longer labor warranty (the promise of quality installation) provided with the installation. — A comprehensive 10-year workmanship warranty is what you should expect, at a minimum, at this price point.</p>
<p>Important Pricing Factors for Asphalt Shingle Replacements:</p>
<p>Depending on the type and overall complexity of the roof (number of floors/levels, number of skylights, chimneys, and dormers, ease of access, and overall roof difficulty), choice of shingles, your home’s geographic location, and the contractor or weekend warrior you choose to hire, your total average cost for a composition shingles roof could range from as low as $3.00 to as high as $7.50 per square foot or $300 to $750 per square installed.</p>
<p>Geographic Considerations:</p>
<p>There will always be significant variations in quoted prices, depending on the contractor you choose to hire and your home’s location. For instance, shingle replacement prices in the deep South (think South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, and most of Louisiana) will generally be significantly lower (as low as $3.00 to $3.50 per sq. ft. installed) compared to prices charged in the North East or on the West Coast (which can be as high as $5.50 to $7.50 per sq. ft.).</p>
<p>A typical ranch style or four-square single-family house in the US will have a roof area of about 15 to 20 squares. — On the low-end, you can expect to pay anywhere from $5,000 to $8,000 for a simple asphalt roof replacement job on a typical four-square or ranch style house, while on the high-end your total cost could range from $9,000 to $15,000 (or even more in some cases) for a more difficult installation, premium materials, and comprehensive workmanship warranty.</p>

Either a contractor can be hired or Roof can be replaced by the Home Owner and save up to 8-12% of the cost.</p>
<p><strong>How to Hire a Roofing Contractor</strong><br>
Types of roofing and rank them by their advantages and disadvantages. The company you hire depends on the material and style you want. If you have a strict budget, keep in mind that the cost of materials for a <strong>2,200 square-foot home</strong> ranges from <strong>$2,500 to $25,000</strong>. The best one for your home may not be the least expensive. A local pro can help you select the most cost-effective options.</p>
<p>-Find Reliable Roofers:<br>
To start your search, find a reputable source like HomeAdvisor that can help you locate qualified roofing professionals with the following services:<br>
-Connect homeowners and local home improvement contractors and help with potential disputes.<br>
-Put contractors through a rigorous ten-step screening process before placing them in the search.<br>
-Provide quality-controlled customer ratings and reviews, so you can see what homeowners think about individual contractors and roof installation.</p>
<p>-Talk to Several Contractors:<br>
You should talk to several roofing companies so you can gauge an honest and reasonable price range. Interview at least three professionals before you make a hiring decision. Compare the bids, but remember that price is just one part of the project. Be wary of any remarkably low or excessively high bids. You probably don’t want to make your decision on a couple hundred dollars for a project that costs several thousand dollars.</p>
<p>-Research Credentials:<br>
Besides getting a few bids from pros, it’s important that you research the contractor you choose. Reputable contractors should be licensed and willing to prove it. Licensing and insurance requirements vary by state, so it’s wise to look into your state’s laws in advance.</p>
<p>-Check References and Experience:<br>
Ask each roofing company for three references verifying their work and follow up on them. This gives you a chance to see how they operate. If your pro hesitates or refuses to share references, keep looking.Plan to hire someone with experience working in your chosen material. A skilled pro will complete your job on time, to code and without mistakes. Hiring an inexperienced pro to save money can lead to additional repairs, extended deadlines and inaccurate pricing</p>
<p>-Review the Contract and Warranties Closely:<br>
Read every contract carefully before signing. Professional contractors won’t be annoyed by you taking the time to understand the terms of your agreement. Most will be happy to sit down with you and explain parts you don’t understand.Make sure you understand the warranty that comes with your new roof. It’s important to have follow-up support in case of an emergency. All materials and workmanship should be guaranteed for at least 5 years. The material itself ought to come with a 20-to-40-year warranty.</p>
<p>-Avoid Wet Seasons<br>
Try to avoid scheduling your job during rainy or snowy seasons. Walking on a roof while it’s wet or icy presents a safety hazard and makes it harder to complete. Most pros will help you find the best time to begin your project.</p>
