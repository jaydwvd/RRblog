<img src="https://ibb.co/dkHq57T" alt="Asphalt Rooftop"><br>
All roofs deteriorate over time and eventually need to be replaced. But, when is the right time to re-roof? When are repairs enough? If you replace your roof too soon, you’ll waste money. If you wait too long, you risk ending up with roof leaks and expensive water damage.<br>
When to re-roof depends on several factors, including the shingles’ wear and age, the climate in your area, and your home’s susceptibility to future damage. If you’re conflicted and can’t decide whether to replace or repair, read on – This blog shall help you make the right call.<br>
Since roofing replacement is a rather costly investment, most homeowners want to postpone it for as long as they can, especially if the roof has reached the stage where it’s starting to have problems but is not not completely shot. The cost of a shingle roof has roughly doubled during the last 10 years, after all so repairs might seem more desirable. For instance, the average reported roofing cost for asphalt shingles is <strong>$5,460- 8,750</strong> on a 1,600 sq. Ft. ranch style home. a rough estimate can be calculated for different types of roofs <a href="https://www.roofcalc.org/why-roofing-prices-keep-going-up/">here</a>Moreover, the contractors charge 8-12 percent more that hey used to charge a few short years ago. Maintenance plays a important role in augmenting the life of the roofs. For example, Asphalt roofs last for 15 to 25 years if proper attention is given to them otherwise it just lasts for 15 years.</p>

<p>We will list out the reasons/factors that affects the roof life and certainly be helpful in determining whether to replace or repair the roof:<br>
<strong>roof’s age</strong> is one of the most important considerations. Most asphalt shingles have a lifespan of about 15 – 30 years. If the roof is damaged but most of it is still in good shape, a spot repair may make sense. But, if the roof is approaching (or past) 20 years old, replacing it may be the better way to go long-term.</p>
<p><strong>there’s a leak</strong><br>
somewhere, <a href="https://allroofingsolutionsde.com/roofing-inspection-101-contractors-3-step-checklist/" title="Roofing inspection">an inspection will help you determine</a> how widespread it is. Often, roofs will leak along flashing points. If this is the case, and the leak is isolated, a quick repair may be all that is necessary. If the roof is <a href="https://allroofingsolutionsde.com/3-most-common-roof-leak-repairs/" title="3 Most Common Roof Leak Repairs">leaking in several places</a>, a roofing replacement may be in order.</p>
<p><strong>how long you intend to be in the home</strong><br>
If you’re planning to sell in the next few years, and the roof is in generally good condition, it may make more sense to have repairs done.If you opt to replace your roof, you may be able to incorporate environmentally-friendly features that qualify for local or federal tax credits to offset the cost. Also, new materials are generally [more energy efficient, last longer, and perform better] (<a href="https://allroofingsolutionsde.com/roofing-replacement-investing-in-quality-materials-is-smart/">https://allroofingsolutionsde.com/roofing-replacement-investing-in-quality-materials-is-smart/</a> “Roofing Replacement: Why Investing In Quality Material Is Smart”) so an upgrade is desirable long-term.</p>
<p><strong>resistant to fire or wind and hail damage</strong><br>
If you’re replacing your roof, you may find that the type and/or quality of roofing material you use can qualify you for significant discounts on your homeowner’s insurance policy. Materials that are more will often result in lower rates.</p>
<p><strong>lay another layer of shingles over the existing roof</strong>,<br>
As you consider the costs, you may or may not be able to rather than removing the current layer and starting “from scratch”. At the same time, <a href="https://allroofingsolutionsde.com/shingle-roofing-replacement-tear-off-vs-adding-a-top-layer/" title="Shingle Roofing Replacement: Tear-Off Vs. Adding A Top Layer">removing the old shingles</a> will allow you to inspect the roof deck or sheathing, and add ice-and-water-shield membrane along the eaves (which can only be applied to a clean deck and will help prevent damage due to ice dams).</p>
<p><strong>consider “hidden costs”</strong>, If you’re thinking about replacing your roof, don’t forget to  including gutter replacement or landscape damage. A reputable roofing contractor will produce a [comprehensive estimate] (<a href="https://allroofingsolutionsde.com/roofing-estimate-101/">https://allroofingsolutionsde.com/roofing-estimate-101/</a> “Roofing Estimates 101”) detailing all of the project’s costs.</p>
<p>Repairs are less expensive but tend to be more of a short-term solution, while a new roof is a big expense but should last you for decades. Either way, make the right decision today and you won’t have to worry about leaks and damage when storms roll through.</p>

<p>**General cost of repairing a roof: **</p>
<p>The average cost for minor roof repairs ranges from $200 to $300. Larger repairs can range from $1,000 for a medium-sized repair job to $3,000 for major repairs. We have a list of few types of costs that can be thought upon:</p>
<p><strong>Common Roof Repairs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Weather damage: A bad storm that features high winds, heavy rain, or falling trees and branches can damage or destroy shingles and cause leaks. Damage may be especially severe if a previous installation or repair job wasn’t done properly.</li>
<li>Aging and wear: Aging shingles on older homes may crack and curl or develop stains, missing granules or moss buildup. In wintry climates, a roof may develop ice dams or salt corrosion. If a roof is more than 10 years old and the problems are extensive, it may be time to replace the entire roof.</li>
<li>Leaks: Leaks can occur in the valleys, the V-shaped areas of the roof that channel water toward the gutters. Valleys are lined with metal strips called flashing, which can be damaged by the removal of nearby shingles, by heavy rain, or by the buildup of moss or fungus. If flashing strips in multiple valleys are damaged, it may be necessary to replace the entire roof. Leaks can also occur around chimneys, vents, and skylights. If left untreated, leaks can cause extensive water damage inside the house.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roof Repair Costs by Material Type</strong><br>
The cost of the roof shingles or tiles directly affects the cost of roof repair. Common roofing materials include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asphalt shingles: $5 to $10 per square foot to repair. Typically the least expensive type of roofing material, with 3-tab shingles costing less than dimensional or architectural shingles. Because asphalt shingles are made with petroleum, they may become more expensive if oil prices increase.<br>
-Cedar or other wood shingles: May be more expensive than asphalt shingles, depending on the type of wood.<br>
-Clay tiles: More expensive than asphalt shingles, clay and terracotta tiles are common in the Southwestern states and coastal communities. They are very durable, especially against the salt and sand found in coastal areas, and can withstand high winds.<br>
-Slate tiles: Roughly $15 per square foot to repair. Slate roofs often carry warranties of 30 years or longer.<br>
-Metal roofs: $5 to $15 per square foot to repair loose seams or damaged fasteners on a metal roof.<br>
Here are some sample asphalt roofing repair prices from two pros in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas (clay, slate or wood shingle repairs will generally cost more).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Size and Design</strong></p>
<p>Roofs and roof repairs are measured in “squares,” 10-foot-by-10-foot areas that equal 100 square feet. The more squares to be repaired, the higher the cost. Flat roofs can cost $4 to $10 per square foot to fix a bad seal or pooling water.If the pitch of the roof is high, expect to pay more as it becomes very difficult to repair roofs with high pitch.</p>
<p>Roofing labour cost per square foot: Labor for roofing projects ranges from $150 to $300 per square or $1.50 to $3 per square foot, depending on factors like the product you’re installing and the conditions of the structure. Labor and overhead usually make up 60% of the project total</p>
<p><strong>Inspection Costs</strong></p>
<p>To determine what kind of roof repairs are needed, a roofing contractor should do an in-person inspection. An inspection from a roofing company may uncover storm damage, roof leaks, or drainage issues such as ponding or pooling of water on the roof and clogging of the gutter system. Homeowners may schedule regular inspections just for peace of mind, or have the roof inspected after a major storm or hurricane or if leaks are suspected. Some insurance companies won’t cover storm damage if claims are filed too late, so a timely inspection after a storm could save homeowners lots of money on repairs.</p>
<p><strong>Time of Year</strong></p>
<p>Demand for roof repairs is greatest in spring and summer, so the cost will typically be higher than when done off-season when laborers’ time is in less demand. The price of new shingles can also be lower during the off-season. That’s why Keto Roofing and Construction/DFW Gutterdome’s cost of labor per square can fluctuate from $40 to $70.</p>
<p>Ideally, roofing repair work is best done when the outdoor temperature is between 40 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit and when there isn’t much chance for rain. Depending on the climate, that could mean early summer or early autumn.</p>
<p><strong>Chimneys, Vents, and Skylights</strong></p>
<p>-Chimneys: To repair a leaking chimney, the shingles around the chimney will need to be removed to access the underlying problem — usually the flashing or a bad seal. Removing the shingles and flashing may reveal other structural problems, such as with the bricks and mortar of the chimney itself, which could increase the cost of repairs. A problem with the chimney could result in leaks inside the house that are nowhere near the chimney, so a contractor will often inspect the chimney even if it’s not obvious that’s where the leak is.<br>
-Vents: The seals and flashing around a roof’s small metal vents can be damaged during a storm and may work themselves loose over time, causing leaks. Because vents are less substantial than a chimney, they can be damaged more easily, especially on older homes. If a vent is leaking, the shingles and flashing around it will have to be replaced. If the interior leak is not directly below the vent and water has damaged the underlayment of the roof, the cost of the repair could go up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Skylights: Skylights often trap water along their edges, which can cause the sealing material to break down over time. If the degradation of materials goes unnoticed for too long, the flashing around a skylight may become rusted or corroded. That leads to a more expensive repair.</li>
